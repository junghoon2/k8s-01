# nodeSelector specifies the set of nodes where the operator can run. By
# default, the operator is restricted to amd64/linux nodes. If a value is
# provided here, it overrides that default. Also, by specifying {} for the
# value, the default can be cleared entirely. The default isn't shown here since
# the proper node labels must be determined dynamically due to differences
# between kube 1.13 and later.
