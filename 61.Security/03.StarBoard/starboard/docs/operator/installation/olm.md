The [Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)][olm] provides a declarative way to install and upgrade operators and their
dependencies.

You can install the Starboard operator from [OperatorHub.io](https://operatorhub.io/operator/starboard-operator)
or [ArtifactHUB](https://artifacthub.io/) by creating the OperatorGroup, which defines the operator's
multitenancy, and Subscription that links everything together to run the operator's pod.

As an example, let's install the operator from the OperatorHub catalog in the `starboard-operator` namespace and
configure it to watch the `default` namespaces:

1. Install the Operator Lifecycle Manager:
   ```
   curl -sL https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/0.16.1/install.sh | bash -s 0.16.1
   ```
2. Create the namespace to install the operator in:
   ```
   kubectl create ns starboard-operator
   ```
3. Declare the target namespaces by creating the OperatorGroup:
   ```
   cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha2
   kind: OperatorGroup
   metadata:
     name: starboard-operator
     namespace: starboard-operator
   spec:
     targetNamespaces:
     - default
   EOF
   ```
4. (Optional) Configure Starboard by creating the `starboard` ConfigMap and the `starboard` secret in
   the `starboard-operator` namespace. For example, you can use Trivy
   in [ClientServer](./../../integrations/vulnerability-scanners/trivy.md#clientserver) mode or
   [Aqua Enterprise](./../../integrations/vulnerability-scanners/aqua-enterprise.md) as an active vulnerability scanner.
   If you skip this step, the operator will ensure [configuration objects](./../../settings.md)
   on startup with the default settings:
   ```
   kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aquasecurity/starboard/{{ var.tag }}/deploy/static/05-starboard-operator.config.yaml
   ```
   Review the default values and makes sure the operator is configured properly:
   ```
   kubectl describe cm starboard -n starboard-operator
   kubectl describe secret starboard -n starboard-operator
   ```
5. Install the operator by creating the Subscription:
   ```
   cat << EOF | kubectl apply -f -
   apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
   kind: Subscription
   metadata:
     name: starboard-operator
     namespace: starboard-operator
   spec:
     channel: alpha
     name: starboard-operator
     source: operatorhubio-catalog
     sourceNamespace: olm
     installPlanApproval: Automatic
     config:
       env:
       - name: OPERATOR_SCAN_JOB_TIMEOUT
         value: "60s"
       - name: OPERATOR_CONCURRENT_SCAN_JOBS_LIMIT
         value: "10"
       - name: OPERATOR_LOG_DEV_MODE
         value: "true"
   EOF
   ```
   The operator will be installed in the `starboard-operator` namespace and will be usable from the `default` namespace.
   Note that the `spec.config` property allows you to override the default [configuration](./../configuration.md) of
   the operator's Deployment.

6. After install, watch the operator come up using the following command:
   ```console
   $ kubectl get clusterserviceversions -n starboard-operator
   NAME                        DISPLAY              VERSION   REPLACES                    PHASE
   starboard-operator.{{ var.tag }}   Starboard Operator   {{ var.build.version }}     starboard-operator.{{ var.tag_prev }}   Succeeded
   ```
   If the above command succeeds and the ClusterServiceVersion has transitioned from `Installing` to `Succeeded` phase
   you will also find the operator's Deployment in the same namespace where the Subscription is:
   ```console
   $ kubectl get deployments -n starboard-operator
   NAME                 READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
   starboard-operator   1/1     1            1           11m
   ```
   If for some reason it's not ready yet, check the logs of the Deployment for errors:
   ```
   kubectl logs deployment/starboard-operator -n starboard-operator
   ```

## Uninstall

To uninstall the operator delete the Subscription, the ClusterServiceVersion, and the OperatorGroup:

```
kubectl delete subscription starboard-operator -n starboard-operator
kubectl delete clusterserviceversion starboard-operator.{{ var.tag }} -n starboard-operator
kubectl delete operatorgroup starboard-operator -n starboard-operator
```

!!! note
    You have to manually delete custom resource definitions created by the OLM operator:
    ```
    kubectl delete crd vulnerabilityreports.aquasecurity.github.io
    kubectl delete crd configauditreports.aquasecurity.github.io
    ```

!!! danger
    Deleting custom resource definitions will also delete all security reports generated by the operator.
