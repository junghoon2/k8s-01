The easiest way to get started with Starboard is to use the `starboard` command, which allows scanning Kubernetes
workloads deployed in your cluster.

To begin with, execute the following one-time setup command:

```
starboard init
```

The `init` subcommand creates the `starboard` namespace, in which Starboard executes Kubernetes jobs to perform
scans. It also sends custom security resources definitions to the Kubernetes API:

```console
$ kubectl api-resources --api-group aquasecurity.github.io
NAME                   SHORTNAMES    APIGROUP                 NAMESPACED   KIND
ciskubebenchreports    kubebench     aquasecurity.github.io   false        CISKubeBenchReport
configauditreports     configaudit   aquasecurity.github.io   true         ConfigAuditReport
kubehunterreports      kubehunter    aquasecurity.github.io   false        KubeHunterReport
vulnerabilityreports   vulns,vuln    aquasecurity.github.io   true         VulnerabilityReport
```

!!! tip
    There's also a `starboard cleanup` subcommand, which can be used to remove all resources created by Starboard.

As an example let's run in the current namespace an old version of `nginx` that we know has vulnerabilities:

```
kubectl create deployment nginx --image nginx:1.16
```

Run the vulnerability scanner to generate vulnerability reports:

```
starboard scan vulnerabilityreports deployment/nginx
```

Behind the scenes, by default this uses [Trivy][trivy] in Standalone mode to identify vulnerabilities in the container
images associated with the specified deployment. Once this has been done, you can retrieve the latest vulnerability
reports for this workload:

```
starboard get vulnerabilities deployment/nginx -o yaml
```

Starboard relies on labels and label selectors to associate vulnerability reports with the specified Deployment.
For a Deployment with *N* container images Starboard creates *N* instances of `vulnerabilityreports.aquasecurity.github.io`
resources. In addition, each instance has the `starboard.container.name` label to associate it with a particular
container's image. This means that the same data retrieved by the `starboard get vulnerabilities` subcommand can be
fetched with the standard `kubectl get` command:

```
kubectl get vulnerabilityreports -o yaml \
  -l starboard.resource.kind=Deployment,starboard.resource.name=nginx
```

In this example, the `nginx` deployment has a single container called `nginx`, hence only one instance of the
`vulnerabilityreports.aquasecurity.github.io` resource is created with the label `starboard.container.name=nginx`.

To read more about custom resources and label selectors check [custom resource definitions][crds].

## Next Steps

Let's take the same `nginx` Deployment and audit its Kubernetes configuration. As you remember we've created it with
the `kubectl create deployment` command which applies the default settings to the deployment descriptors. However, we
also know that in Kubernetes the defaults are usually the least secure.

Run the scanner to audit the configuration using [Polaris][polaris]:

```
starboard scan configauditreports deployment/nginx
```

Retrieve the configuration audit report:

```
starboard get configaudit deployment/nginx -o yaml
```

or

```
kubectl get configauditreport -o yaml \
  -l starboard.resource.kind=Deployment,starboard.resource.name=nginx
```
